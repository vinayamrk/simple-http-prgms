	sources).

	problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of maths, natural science and
	engineering science.
	
	Modern tool usage: Create, select and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern 
	engineering and IT tools including, prediction and modelling to complex engineering activities
	with an understanding of the limitations.
	
	Communication: Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering
	community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write effective 
	reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and give and receive clear
